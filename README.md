# 💡 LFF

LFF is a plugin designed for HCF servers that allows players to **request recruitment** in an organized way, choosing their classes and marking themselves as “Looking For Faction”.

***

## ✨ What does the plugin do?

- Opens a menu where the player can mark that they are **looking for a faction**.  
- Lets players select their **class** (archer, bard, diamond, etc. depending on your config).  
- Makes it easy for faction leaders to quickly see who is available and which class they play.  

Perfect for busy servers where chat is constantly spammed with “lff @here”.
